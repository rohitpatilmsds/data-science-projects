# 🚗 The Kia/Hyundai Theft Crisis: A Data-Driven Call to Action

## 🎯 Audience

This data story is designed for a **broad audience**, including:
- The **public**, especially current and potential **Kia and Hyundai owners**
- **Local government officials**
- **Automotive industry stakeholders**

Our focus is to interpret data in an **accessible and engaging** way. Technical jargon is deliberately avoided to ensure clarity. For the public, the emphasis is on **protecting their lives and property**; for policymakers and the industry, it’s about recognizing the **urgency and scale** of the crisis — and the need for systemic solutions.

## 🧭 Purpose

The goal of this data story is to **highlight the growing epidemic** of Kia and Hyundai vehicle thefts driven by a widely publicized hacking vulnerability.  
This narrative goes beyond awareness — it’s a **call to action**.  
We aim to help the audience:
- Understand the **scope and speed** of the issue  
- Recognize **which vehicles are affected**  
- Feel **motivated to act** before the situation escalates further  

---

## 📣 Call to Action

The response we seek is **two-fold**:

1. **For vehicle owners:**  
   - Take proactive steps such as software updates and steering locks  
   - Engage with community safety and awareness efforts  

2. **For manufacturers and policymakers:**  
   - Accelerate permanent security fixes  
   - Fund **public education and awareness campaigns**  

Together, these efforts can reduce thefts, restore public trust, and strengthen consumer safety.

## 🖼️ Medium

Given the diversity of our audience, this project uses **multi-platform visual storytelling** for maximum reach:
- **Eye-catching infographics** and **data visualizations** for social media and public campaigns  
- **A written report** (this document) for context, nuance, and interpretation  
- **Community and policy presentations** for decision-making and advocacy  

This structure ensures accessibility, engagement, and broad impact.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Our visual and narrative design prioritizes **clarity, emotional resonance, and impact** — informed by Gestalt design principles.

### **Color**
- 🔴 **Red:** Kia/Hyundai thefts — signals danger, urgency, and focus  
- 🔵 **Steel Blue:** All other thefts — provides calm contrast  
- ⚪ **Neutral Grays:** Maintain visual balance and emphasize data  

### **Text**
- Bold, action-oriented **titles** communicate each key insight  
- **Annotations** are concise and well-placed for clarity  
- **Readable fonts** optimized for digital media  

### **Alignment & Spacing**
- Logical grouping and alignment highlight relationships  
- Clean layouts minimize cognitive load and visual fatigue  

### **Sizing**
- Larger or distinct sizing for key metrics (e.g., peak theft numbers, percentage spikes) ensures quick recognition of critical data points  

### **Visual Types**
| Visualization | Purpose | Key Principle |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| **Stacked Area Chart (Milwaukee)** | Shows Kia/Hyundai thefts overtaking total thefts | Continuity |
| **Stacked Bar Chart (Top 5 Cities)** | Compares city-level theft types | Similarity & Common Region |
| **Donut Chart (Chicago Peak)** | Highlights extreme imbalance during theft spikes | Emphasis |
| **Treemap (Overall Thefts)** | Shows city-level magnitude and hotspots | Enclosure |
| **Geographic Map (Percent Change)** | Displays national distribution and growth trends | Common Fate |
| **Line Chart (Monthly Trends)** | Tracks theft evolution across cities | Differentiation by Color |

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

### **Data Changes**
- Base file: `Motherboard_VICE_News_Kia_Hyundai_Theft_Data_Cleaned.csv`  
- Derived columns (e.g., `countOtherThefts`) computed from existing totals  
- Records with missing or zero totals filtered only for meaningful comparisons  
- **No original data values were altered** — only reshaped for analysis  

### **Legal & Regulatory Compliance**
- Data is **publicly available**, primarily from **police departments** and **journalistic reports**  
- No **personally identifiable information (PII)** used  

### **Risks of Presentation**
- **Alarmism:** Bold visuals may heighten concern  
- **Misinterpretation:** Could imply all Kia/Hyundai models are at risk  
- **Victim Blaming:** Risk of misplacing responsibility on owners  
- **Brand Impact:** Potential reputational damage for manufacturers  

### **Assumptions**
- Source files (`KiaHyundaiMilwaukeeData.csv`, `carTheftsMap.csv`, etc.) are accurate reflections of public records  
- Filters applied for simplicity (e.g., `total_thefts > 1000`, `abs(percentChange2019to2022) > 0.5`) are explicitly noted  

### **Data Credibility & Ethics**
- Data originates from **reputable journalistic and law enforcement sources**  
- **Ethically obtained** and publicly available — no private data accessed  

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Provide **context** explaining causes (vulnerability) rather than focusing solely on outcomes  
- Promote **balanced narrative** — emphasizing responsibility across all stakeholders  
- Use **titles and annotations** for clarity and interpretation  
- Focus on **trends**, not isolated figures  
- Encourage **empowerment** — helping people act, not panic  

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Normalize analysis across additional datasets (e.g., by vehicle model year or region)  
- Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast theft trends  
- Develop **interactive dashboards** for real-time public tracking  
- Analyze **policy response effectiveness** over time
