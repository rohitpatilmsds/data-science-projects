## 🎯 Audience

**Primary Audience:** Netflix Executives – *Content Strategy, Originals & International Programming*

This report is tailored for decision-makers responsible for shaping Netflix’s content investment strategy. These executives seek actionable insights that go beyond vanity metrics to identify **replicable success patterns**—those that can guide investments in globally scalable franchises emerging from regional markets.

They operate in a landscape of rising competition and shifting audience behaviors. With mature markets showing slower growth, global expansion depends on unlocking engagement through high-performing regional content.

Our audience wants to find “the next *Squid Game*, *Lupin*, or *Money Heist*”—not by luck, but through **evidence-based confidence** in data-backed global storytelling opportunities.

International originals have transformed Netflix’s content landscape. Projects such as *Squid Game* (Korea), *Lupin* (France), and *Money Heist* (Spain) proved that **localized content can achieve global reach** when aligned with universal genres and compelling storytelling.

This report examines multiple Netflix datasets to reveal patterns in:

* 🌍 **Global viewership rankings** and audience growth over time
* 🎞️ **Category-level performance** (series vs films, drama vs documentary, etc.)
* 📈 **Regional interest trends** to identify future hotspots for content investment

### Evidence-Based Goals

1. Justify expanding investments in international originals
2. Identify genres and regions with sustained engagement
3. Recommend **three pilot concepts** with high global franchise potential
